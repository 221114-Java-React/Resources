# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Keywords

_Data Structure_ a way for storing data and organizing data. It's a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
_Linear Data Structure_ elements are arranged in sequence. There's an order to them. Ex: arrays, stack, queue, linkedlist
_Non linear data structure_ elements aren't stored in a sequence, instead, they are connected in a hierarchal manner. Ex: graphs, trees
_Algorithm_ a finite set of instructions that, if followed, accomplishes a particular task. It has the ff characteristics:

1. Input
2. Output
3. Definite - each instruction must be clear and unambiguous
4. Finite - there must be a beginning and an end
5. Effective - each operation must be doable

## Data Structures and Algorithms how are they related

Given a problem, you arrange the data using data structures and come up with an algorithm that leverages that data structure to come up with a solution.

ex: Palindrome Problem
Using stack data structure, create a copy of the original word, for every letter in the word, you push it in a stack. Pop the stack until it is empty and append each popped letter to a string that would contain the reversed version of the word. Compare and return the result.

## Algorithm Types

1. Brute Force
2. Greedy
3. Divide and conquer
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Backtracking
