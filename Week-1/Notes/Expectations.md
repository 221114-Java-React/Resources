# Great (training) Expectations

1. If you have a question during training, raise your virtual hand. I will come to a natural stopping point for you to ask your questions.
2. My office hours are from 10-6 EST Monday - Fridays. I am available during these hours, any messages after work will be entertained on the next business day.
3. Debugging, try solving the problem first. If it's really difficult to resolve on your own, come by and bring the resources you've tried to resolve the bug.
4. Please message before going into my BR. I might not be available or just having a private meal while catching up on emails.
5. Practice professional vocabulary and communication habits. Avoid language or behavior that you wouldn't want to use/do amongst children.
6. Keep your camera on during training. (If I have to look professional and presentable so do you)
7. Adhere to dress code.
